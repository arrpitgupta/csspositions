# csspositions
Here are brief explanations and code examples for each CSS position: static, fixed, sticky, relative, and absolute.

Static: The default position value for an element. It follows the normal document flow and is not affected by the top, bottom, left, or right properties.

Fixed: Positions the element relative to the browser window, regardless of scrolling. It stays fixed even when the page is scrolled.

Sticky: Acts like a combination of relative and fixed positioning. It remains in the normal flow until a specified scroll threshold is met, after which it becomes fixed.

Relative: Positions the element relative to its normal position in the document flow. It allows you to adjust the position using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

Absolute: Positions the element relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any. If no positioned ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the document body.
It is taken out of the normal flow and other elements are positioned as if it doesn't exist.
